  > Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation.

- [DiffKG: Knowledge Graph Diffusion Model for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16890)
  Authors: Yangqin Jiang, Yuhao Yang, Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang
  Published Dec 28, 2023

  > Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as invaluable resources for enriching recommendation systems by providing a wealth of factual information and capturing semantic relationships among items. Leveraging KGs can significantly enhance recommendation performance. However, not all relations within a KG are equally relevant or beneficial for the target recommendation task. In fact, certain item-entity connections may introduce noise or lack informative value, thus potentially misleading our understanding of user preferences. To bridge this research gap, we propose a novel knowledge graph diffusion model for recommendation, referred to as DiffKG.

- [Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: A Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08302)
  Authors: Shirui Pan, Linhao Luo, Yufei Wang, Chen Chen, Jiapu Wang, Xindong Wu
  Published Jun 14, 2023

  > Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge.

  Published on Oct 6, 2023

  > Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex relationships in real-world applications such as social networks, recommender systems, and computational finance. Reasoning on graphs is essential for drawing inferences about the relationships between entities in a complex system, and to identify hidden patterns and trends. Despite the remarkable progress in automated reasoning with natural text, reasoning on graphs with large language models (LLMs) remains an understudied problem.

- [From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130/)
  Authors: Darren Edge, Ha Trinh, Newman Cheng, Joshua Bradley, Alex Chao, Apurva Mody, Steven Truitt, Jonathan Larson

  > The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed.

- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graphs for Customer Service Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17723)
  Authors: Zhentao Xu, Mark Jerome Cruz, Matthew Guevara, Tie Wang, Manasi Deshpande, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Li

  > In customer service technical support, swiftly and accurately retrieving relevant past issues is critical for efficiently resolving customer inquiries. The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG).
